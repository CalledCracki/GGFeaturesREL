<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="120" height="120">

Originally started by Niklas409, this long-standing project includes the most important and well-known features of one of the largest German networks. After 3 years without any improvements or updates there is finally the GGFeatures version 4.0!

Some of the most important changes:
* The new system is now available for all versions starting from the 1.8 version!
* As a Patreon member you will get earlier access to the latest changes and more bonuses.
* You can now also apply on our Discord server as a supporter, moderator or developer! :smile:

_You can find more information here:_ **LINK COMING SOON**

<!-- Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template! -->

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here you will learn the most important steps how to use the GGFeaturesREL system on your server.

### Prerequisites

If you don't want to use your own system, it is recommended to install one of the plugins listed below.

<h2>Permission System</h2>
<h3>PermissionsEx</h3>
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/PEXPlugins/PermissionsEx

<h3>LuckPerms</h3>
Spigot Resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms

<h2>Money System</h2>
<h3>EssentialsX</h3>
Spigot Ressource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/

Github Repository: https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials


### Installation

_Here you will learn briefly and concisely how to install and set up GGFeatures correctly._

1. Download the plugin from the official Spigot site. [(LINK COMING SOON)]
2. Put the downloaded .jar file into the plugins folder of your server.
3. Reload your server with /reload.
4. _Check if there is an error in the console._
5. With the command /gg you can check if the installation was successful.
6. In your plugins folder, the "GGFeatures" folder should now have been created.

_In this folder there are even more new files and folders._
_The file named "config.yml" is the center of your system 
and manages the most important settings._
_There you can customize everything as it is most convenient for you._
